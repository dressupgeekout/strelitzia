# Strelitzia Engine

**Strelitzia** is simple and straightforward game engine, suitable for
creating visual novels.  It's written in plain C and interprets game scripts
written in Ruby.

It's intended to be a very small and portable way to author your own
multimedia applications, in particular if they are story-driven


## Building Strelitzia

The following libraries are required in order to build Strelitza:

- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_mixer
- SDL2_ttf


The following libraries are shipped with Strelitza, and therefore you have
the option to build them here "as-is", OR to use separate, precompiled
packages:
